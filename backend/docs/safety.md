# Safety Rules for Home Repairs

## Stop immediately and call a professional if:

- You smell gas or suspect a gas leak.
- Water is leaking near electrical outlets, breaker panels, or appliances.
- The ceiling is bulging, sagging, or actively dripping.
- You cannot identify the shutoff valve and water is actively flowing.

## Water shutoff basics

- For sinks and toilets, local shutoff valves are usually under the sink or behind the toilet.
- Turn clockwise to close. If stuck, do not force with excessive torque.

## Electricity caution

- If there is any chance water contacted electrical components, shut off power at the breaker before touching anything.
