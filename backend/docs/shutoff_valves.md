# Finding Shutoff Valves

## Under-sink shutoff

- Usually two valves (hot/cold) under the sink.
- Turn clockwise to shut off.

## Toilet shutoff

- Small valve behind the toilet near the wall.
- Turn clockwise to shut off.

## Main water shutoff

- Often near the water meter or where water enters the building.
- Use only if local shutoff cannot stop flow.
