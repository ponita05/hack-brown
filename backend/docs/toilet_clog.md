# Toilet Clog

## Symptoms

- Water rises after flush, slow drain, overflow risk.

## Step-by-step (DIY)

1. Stop flushing. Remove tank lid and close flapper if water keeps filling.
2. Use a flange plunger (toilet plunger) 10–20 plunges.
3. Use a toilet auger if plunging fails.
4. If the toilet overflows easily or backs up into tub/shower, call a plumber (possible main line issue).

## When to call a professional

- Repeated clogs despite plunging/auger
- Multiple drains backing up
- Sewage smell or gurgling in multiple fixtures
