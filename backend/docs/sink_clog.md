# Sink Drain Clog (Bathroom/Kitchen)

## Symptoms

- Slow draining, standing water, gurgling sounds, bad odor.

## Likely causes

- Hair/soap scum (bathroom)
- Grease/food debris (kitchen)
- Blocked P-trap

## Step-by-step (DIY)

1. Remove standing water (cup/bucket).
2. Try a plunger: seal overflow if present; plunge 10–15 times.
3. Clean the P-trap:
   - Put a bucket under the trap
   - Loosen slip nuts
   - Remove debris and rinse
4. If still clogged, use a drain snake 3–10 ft into the drain.
5. Run hot water for 1–2 minutes to confirm flow.

## Avoid

- Do not mix chemical drain cleaners with other chemicals.
- Avoid repeated chemical cleaner use; can damage pipes.
